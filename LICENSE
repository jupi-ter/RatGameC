   c) Modify the Engine and create Engine Derivative Works for non-commercial
      purposes, provided that You comply with Section 3 and Section 4.

   d) Use the Engine internally within your organization for game development
      without distribution, including for the development of commercial Games.


3. CONDITIONS OF DISTRIBUTION

   You may Distribute the Engine or any Engine Derivative Work only if ALL
   of the following conditions are met:

   a) ATTRIBUTION: You must retain the original copyright notice and this
      License in its entirety in all copies and substantial portions of the
      Engine. You must include a prominent notice that You have modified the
      Engine and the date of such modifications, if distributing an Engine
      Derivative Work.

   b) SAME LICENSE: Any Engine Derivative Work you Distribute must be
      licensed under this License, verbatim. You may not impose additional
      restrictions beyond those in this License, and you may not grant
      additional permissions not present in this License.

   c) SOURCE AVAILABILITY: If you Distribute a compiled or binary form of
      the Engine or an Engine Derivative Work, you must make the complete
      corresponding source code available under this License, either bundled
      with the distribution or via a publicly accessible URL that remains
      accessible for no less than three (3) years from the date of
      distribution.

   d) NON-COMMERCIAL ONLY: The Engine and any Engine Derivative Work may only
      be Distributed at no cost and for no monetary compensation. You may not
      sell, charge for, or monetize the Engine or any Engine Derivative Work
      in any form. Distribution must be free of charge.


4. COPYLEFT REQUIREMENT

   Any Engine Derivative Work must be licensed under this License in its
   entirety. You may not relicense an Engine Derivative Work under any other
   license, including the MIT License, Apache License, GPL, or any
   proprietary license. The copyleft obligation applies to the Engine and
   Engine Derivative Works only; it does not propagate to Games built using
   the Engine.


5. RESTRICTIONS

   The following are expressly prohibited:

   a) COMMERCIAL USE OF THE ENGINE PROHIBITED: You may not use, Distribute,
      sell, license, or offer the Engine or any Engine Derivative Work for
      any Commercial Purpose. This prohibition covers the Engine itself and
      any fork, port, adaptation, or modification of the Engine.

      For clarity: this restriction applies to the Engine as a software
      product or tool. It does not restrict You from commercially releasing,
      selling, or distributing Games that you build using the Engine.

   b) AI TRAINING PROHIBITED: You may not use the Engine, its source code,
      its documentation, or any Engine Derivative Work for any AI Training
      Purpose, whether commercial or non-commercial.

   c) MONETIZED HOSTING: You may not offer the Engine or any Engine Derivative
      Work as a paid hosted service, software-as-a-service, or cloud platform.

   d) SUBLICENSING UNDER DIFFERENT TERMS: You may not sublicense the Engine
      or any Engine Derivative Work under any license other than this License.


6. GAMES BUILT WITH THE ENGINE

   Games that You build using the Engine are Your own creative works. This
   License does not restrict how You own, license, sell, or distribute Your
   Games. You may release Games under any license you choose, including
   proprietary and commercial licenses. You do not owe royalties or fees to
   the Licensor for Games you release using the Engine.

   The Engine runtime or libraries that are linked into or distributed with
   Your Game remain subject to this License. You must include a copy of this
   License and an attribution notice with any Game you distribute that bundles
   Engine binaries or source code. A brief notice in your credits, readme, or
   About screen is sufficient for attribution.


7. CONTRIBUTIONS

   If You submit contributions to the Licensor for inclusion in the Engine,
   You grant the Licensor a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free
   license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute your contribution under
   this License or any future version of this License chosen by the Licensor.


8. TERMINATION

   Your rights under this License terminate automatically and immediately if
   You breach any of its terms. Upon termination, You must cease all use,
   distribution, and modification of the Engine and destroy all copies in
   Your possession. Termination of your rights does not affect the rights of
   others who have received copies under this License and remain in compliance.

   The Licensor may reinstate Your rights upon written notice if the breach
   is cured within thirty (30) days of the Licensor notifying You of the
   breach, at the Licensor's sole discretion.


9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

   THE ENGINE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE
   LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE ENGINE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS,
   OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, OR BE FREE OF ERRORS OR DEFECTS, AND DOES
   NOT WARRANT THE SUITABILITY OF THE ENGINE FOR ANY PARTICULAR GAME OR
   APPLICATION.

   YOU ASSUME ALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THE ENGINE. THIS DISCLAIMER
   OF WARRANTIES IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF THE ENGINE
   IS AUTHORIZED EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.


10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
    LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
    PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR
    PROFITS; LOSS OF REVENUE FROM GAMES; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER
    CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT
    LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
    OUT OF THE USE OF THE ENGINE OR GAMES BUILT WITH THE ENGINE, EVEN IF
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.


11. MISCELLANEOUS

    a) This License constitutes the entire agreement between You and the
       Licensor with respect to the Engine.

    b) If any provision of this License is found to be unenforceable, such
       provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it
       enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force.

    c) The failure of the Licensor to enforce any provision of this License
       shall not be construed as a waiver of the right to enforce such
       provision in the future.

    d) This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
       laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensor is domiciled, without
       regard to conflict of law principles.

    e) For commercial licensing inquiries (e.g., if you wish to sell a fork of
       the Engine or use the Engine in a commercial context not covered by this
       License), contact the Licensor directly.
